# Deep Learning at the Edge

This repository contains the software developed to my Master Thesis about detecting violence situations at the Edge.

A prototype was built consisting of:

* [A Raspberry Pi 3 B+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/)
* [A Intel Movidius Myriad 2 Vision Processing Unit](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/es/es/ark/products/140109/intel-neural-compute-stick-2.html)
* [An USB webcam Logitech C920 HD PRO](https://www.logitech.com/en-hk/products/webcams/c920-pro-hd-webcam.960-001062.html)

All the information found in this repository assumes that Linux is used.
